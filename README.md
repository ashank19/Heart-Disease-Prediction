# Heart-Disease-Prediction
•	Extracted the heart disease dataset from UCI Machine Learning repository to develop machine learning model unsupervised for identifying a possible heart disease at an early stage. 
•	Performed exploratory data analysis using such as correlation coefficient among independent variables, outliers in the dataset, relation between categorical and continuous variables using ANOVA.
•	Normalized the dataset and performed principal component analysis to extract principal components which explained 50% of variability in the dataset.
•	Used different clustering methods to identify the patients having heart disease with an accuracy of 84%. Prepared R Shiny dashboard for visualization of clustering results using different metrics.
